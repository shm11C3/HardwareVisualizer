            This PR was created automatically.

            - Ran `npm update` to refresh transitive dependencies within existing semver ranges
            - Regenerated `package-lock.json`

            Notes:
            - This is intentionally different from Dependabot: it can move transitive deps even when direct deps are unchanged.
